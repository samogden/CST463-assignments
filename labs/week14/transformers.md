# Lab: Transformers

Please work with your team.

## Questions

### Q1
Get out an actual piece of paper and a pen/pencil.  Looking at the Geron picture of a transformer, draw the encoding part by hand.  Try doing it a second time from memory.


### Q2
Walk through the code in the lecture together with your teammates to see how it relates to the diagrams of the transformer architecture.

### Q3
Look in Section 11.4.3 in the Chollet text (see our O'Reilly class playlist) and look at Chollet's code for text classification with the transformer encoder.

### Q4
Go to huggingface.co and see if you can figure out how to get a pretrained model for text classification.  How would you use the model?  Does it cost money to download it?  You may want to refer to our Geron text, which discusses huggingface.
