# Lab: Backprop for logistic regression

Work closely with your team; compare your answers and resolve any differences.

## General

  We will assume these values:

```math
\begin{matrix}
x = (1, 0.5, 2.0) \\
b = (0.1, 1, 0.5) \\
y = 0 \\
\end{matrix}

```

## Q1
Using paper/pencil/calculator/Python console, and your answers from the previous lab, manually work through steps 1-6 of slide 5 of the lecture.  Do not code up the process.  
See if you get the same answer as your teammates.  I want to make sure you understand the process.

## Q2
Compare the result to what you'd get if you used your result from the last lab (in other words, if you used $`\frac{\delta z}{\beta_0}`$, etc.).

### Q3
If you still have time, modify the diagram we have for logistic regression so that it captures linear regression.


## Q4
Create the equations for your linear regression model.

## Q5
Compute the partial derivatives you need for your linear regression model

## Q6
If you *still* have time, repeat problem 2 but for linear regression.
