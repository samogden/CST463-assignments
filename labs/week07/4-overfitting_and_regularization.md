Please work with your team.   Try to answer without looking at the lecture nodes or other sources.  If you canâ€™t remember, discuss for a while with your partner before checking a source.
1.	Here is a [link](chollet-3.6-classifying-newswires.ipynb) to Chollet's code for an example in chapter 3 of his text:
2.	Use Colab or Jupyter notebooks to load the code.  Try the techniques described in lecture with this code:
    - Learning rate
    - Learning rate scheduling
    - Early stopping
    - Weight regularization
    - Dropout
Be sure to play with the hyperparameters of each mechanism.
