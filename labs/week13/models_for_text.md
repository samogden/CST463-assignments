# Lab: Set vs Sequence models for text

Please work with your team.   

## Steps
1.  Download [Chollet's Chapter 11 notebook](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/chapter11_part01_introduction.ipynb) (also available [here](chapter11_part01_introduction.ipynb)) and open it in Colab.  Work through the code, starting with 'Bigrams with binary encoding'.  Spend 10 minutes on this.
2.  Download [Chollet's second Chapter 11 notebook](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/chapter11_part02_sequence-models.ipynb) and open it in Colab.  Work through the code, understanding it and running it.  Keep going if you get to the section on padding and masking.

Refer to [Chapter 11 of Chollet's text](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-with/9781617296864/Text/11.xhtml) as needed
