Note: this repo is currently used for hosting assignments, but not going to have live assignments.
If you want to use it please ensure you make a private fork to ensure nobody else can see your answers.
Instructions on doing so can be found [here](setting_up_a_private_fork.md).
Failure to do so can cause problems with academic honesty due to effectively sharing answers.
