# Build a CNN-based activity recognizer

## Purpose.  

To get experience with time series classification using a 1D convolutional neural net.

## Instructions.  

Do the work on your own.  You must not look at solutions or program code that are not your own (this includes code on the web about activity recognition). Of course, you can discuss the assignment with the instructors. 

Download [activity-recognition-cnn.ipynb](activity_recognition_cnn.ipynb) and read the instructions in the file.  Don't change the file name.

## Submission.  
Submit your edited [activity-recognition.ipynb](activity_recognition_cnn.ipynb) file on Canvas.


## Grading.  

There are no points for problems 1 and 2 -- your answers there will affect your score on later problems.
Points for problems 3-6 will be awarded based on technical judgment, clean code, sufficient commentary, and the level of accuracy you achieve.  
Points for problem 7 will be awarded based on thoughtfulness and clarity.

| Problem   | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Problem 1 | 0      |
| Problem 2 | 0      |
| Problem 3 | 35     |
| Problem 4 | 10     |
| Problem 5 | 10     |
| Problem 6 | 35     |
| Problem 7 | 10     |
