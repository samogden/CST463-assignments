# Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression

## Important: 
homework is to be done completely on your own.


## Purpose.  

Gradient descent is used a lot in machine learning and is specifically used in deep learning.   This assignment will help you better understand gradient descent, especially when used to find the optimal values of multivariable functions.

## Instructions.  

Download [this notebook](grad_desc_multivar_log_regr.ipynb) and then modify according to the instructions at the top of the file.  
You can compare the output of your code to the output of [my solution](grad_desc_multivar_log_regr_solution.pdf).

## Submission.  

`Restart and run all` before submission.  
Submit your edited .ipynb file.   
Do not change the name of the notebook.
