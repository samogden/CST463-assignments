# Predicting the author from a text sample

# Purpose.  
To learn to perform text classification with Keras.  Also, I want you to get more experience in searching the web or using ChatGPT when solving problems.

# Instructions.   

Please read carefully!

Your goal is to create a Keras model to predict the author given a sample of the author's writing.  

I downloaded six novels from Project Gutenberg, created about 1200 three-sentence excerpts from each novel, and stored the data in a form that makes it easy to process.

The data containing the excerpts is in the github repository for this class.  The file is named 'book_excerpts.tar.gz'.   It is in a form that can be easily read with keras.utils.text_dataset_from_dictionary().   In particular, the data is structured as a directory with 'train' and 'test' subdirectories.  Underneath the 'train' directory is a directory for each author.  Underneath an author directory are a lot of files, each containing an excerpt from the author's novel.

The notebook I wrote to do the data preparation is here.  At the end of the file is an example showing how to use keras.utils.text_dataset_from_dictionary().

Rules for the assignment:
-	Your solution should be in the form of a notebook.
-	You can use code you find on the web, or code generated by ChatGPT.  However, whenever you do this, you must clearly document it.
-	Do not discuss the assignment with classmates or others.
-	Use techniques covered in class.  This includes the use of transformers.  However, since the data set is not very large, simpler methods may outperform fancier methods.  If you like, consider using a predefined embedding.

This assignment is supposed to be easy.  You don't need to create a big notebook.  There are some examples online and in our text that are very similar to this problem.  For example:
-	Section 11.3 of our Chollet text shows how to do IMDB review classification.
-	This Keras page also has an IMDB example in which text_dataset_from_dictionary() is used.

## Submission
Submit your [author_prediction.ipynb](author_prediction_gold.ipynb) file on Canvas.  Please use this filename.

## Grading

You can earn from 0 to 100 points.  See rubric below.

Points are only awarded if you have a finished, working model.  So, start with something simple, and then try alternatives and improvements.  
Bounty points are possible if you go beyond.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Your notebook is clear and well-organized.  There should be at least a title, a short intro at the beginning, and conclusions at the end.  Throughout the notebook you should clearly explain what you are doing.  Please make it easy for me to review your notebook! | 20        |
| You exercised good technical judgment.  Really, I want to see that you didn't do anything that doesn't make sense.  For example, think about how you want to use the test data.                                                                                        | 20        |
| You clearly identified any code that you borrowed.  It is perfectly fine to borrow code, just be sure to cite your sources (including ChatGPT).                                                                                                                        | 10        |
| Your model achieves a reasonable classification accuracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 40        |
|Your model achieves high classification accuracy.  This is subjective, and I may award partial points in this category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 10        |
