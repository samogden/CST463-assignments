# Coding: Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

## Important: 
You are to do homework completely on your own.  This includes not looking at solutions you might find on the web.

## Purpose.  
Gradient descent is used a lot in machine learning and is specifically used in deep learning.   This assignment will help you better understand gradient descent, especially when used to find the optimal values of multivariable functions.

## Instructions.  
Download [grad_desc_lin_regr.ipynb](grad_desc_lin_regr.ipynb) and then modify according to the instructions at the top of the file.  You can compare the output of your code to the output of my solution.
