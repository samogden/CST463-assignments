# Modern CNN architecture patterns for CIFAR-10 classification

## Instructions

The CIFAR-10 image set contains 50000 training images and 10000 test images.  The images are small color images of 32x32 pixels belonging to 10 classes, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, and dog.  The data is available as a built-in Keras dataset.

Download [cifar_architectures.ipynb](cifar_architectures.ipynb) and follow the instructions at the top of the file.

## Submission.  

Submit your modified notebook.  Please do not change the filename.

## Grading.   

Here is the grading rubric for your submitted code.  Max score is 100.  Points for each problem will depend on technical correctness, results, tidy code, and clear commentary.  
What I am looking for is good judgment in writing code, careful observations of the results of your tests, and thoughtful commentary.
