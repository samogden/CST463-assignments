# Final project: update

The purpose of the project update is to make sure you're making steady progress on your project..

## Instructions:

Each team should fill out the [template project update document](update-template.docx).
Each team should provide a notebook showing your first, baseline results, and any further results you have .   I do not expect this to be a polished report.  It should just show the code you've written and the output you've obtained.  Provide only one code file.  

## Submission.  

Only one person from each team should submit two files on Canvas:
- a PDF version of your project update document (use filename `project-update.pdf`)
- an .ipynb. (use filename `project.ipynb`)

## Grading.  

This project update is worth 15% of your overall project score.  Each team member will get the same credit aside from teamwork participation adjustments that I reserve the right to make independently of the rubric below.

- (70%) Progress towards baseline.  Full credit if you've reached your baseline goal and can quantify how well it is working.   By "baseline goal", I mean the first goal in your project definition.
- (15%) Clear project update.  Full credit if I can get a clear picture of your progress from the report.
- (15%) Teamwork.  You should be communicating a lot, coordinating with each other, and helping each other to be fully engaged.  The worse-case scenario is when team members are working independently on the same goal.  
  - The instructor reserves the right to impose an additional teamwork penalty on individuals if there are serious teamwork problems.
