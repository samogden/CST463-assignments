# Final Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to give you some experience in a realistic deep-learning project.   By 'realistic' I mean that you can take advantage of any resources you can find.

## Instructions
- Select a project from the list of project ideas.
- Figure out how to solve the problem.  This will involve reviewing course material and web research to see how others have solved it.  It is okay to borrow code, to use ChatGPT, etc., but you must document every resource you use.
- Since you won't have a lot of time and probably won't have a lot of data, I expect you to try to leverage a pretrained model (see Section 8.3 of Chollet, Section 'Reusing Pretrained Layers' in Chapter 10 of Geron, and Section 'Hugging Face’s Transformers Library' in Chapter 16 of Geron).  You  may want to compare your results when you don't leverage a pretrained model with when you do.  Also, don't forget about the possibility of using pretrained embeddings, like GloVe.
- You must go beyond solutions that you find.  For example, if you are working on a classification problem, can you achieve better accuracy?
- Your final report must be a .ipynb file with all code and output showing.  The report should be well-organized and include plenty of commentary on the problem.  Be sure to identify your data set and list all the sources (including code) that you used.
- Meet with the instructor regularly during the project to make sure you are heading in the right direction.

## Submission

Each team will submit one ipynb file that shows code and all output.  The team member responsible for submitting is shown on the project teams sheet -- only the submitter of each team will submit.  Coordinate with your teammates!!

***Late submissions are absolutely not accepted***, so don’t submit at the last minute.

I will also ask you to complete a questionnaire in which you will estimate how much of the project work was completed by you and your teammates.

## Grading

I will assess your project using your final report and on teamwork.  The max score is 100.  

Grading components:
- 30: baseline results
  - Code that works and demonstrates that your baseline milestone was reached.
- 20: final results
- Co  ing serious effort in trying to go beyond the baseline.
- 25: engineering judgment
  - Do you do sensible things?  Did you do the sensible things first?  Did you try to get past obstacles in a sensible way?  
  - Was your work informed by your broad knowledge of data science and machine learning?
- 25: documentation
  - Is your notebook clear and well-organized?  There should be clear sections, and each section should start with a sentence or two of text.
  - Did you document the sources you borrowed from?  Did you make clear what you borrowed and what you developed yourself?
  - Were your results clearly spelled out?  Did you use appropriate plots in doing so?
  - Did you clearly summarize the main challenges that you faced?
- (+/- 10 points) teamwork and participation
  - Did you participate?
  - Did you attend class every project day?
  - Were you a good team player?
  - I will adjust individual grades based on participation.  Normally, the adjustment will be between -10 and 10 points, but reserve the right to deduct 50 points or more if I believe your participation was very low.
